## Road Map

- X done / undone state (comparing dates /vs/ next to do date)
- X padding bottom in prep (change & list) to see the items when scrolling
- settings (dark mode & other customisations)
- X undone button in prep
- X view only to-do tasks in take action page
- X priority as colours
- X disable repetition extras
- X repetition day as names from list
- form examples (empty input => shadow text)
- "?" into pop up explaining the form inputs
- X foldable categories
- X better-looking action cards
- better looking category display
- X keep same view (actions / categories) and same fold between tabs
- fix visual bug : unending action card box
